# AnimatedLogin

A New Project with the objective the learn about animations in swift, I used the library native UIView.animate().

The screen simulates a login screen and validates the following fields:
- Login inserted is CORRECT?
- Password inserted is CORRECT?
case both questions are correct, your login is confirmed with success.

To test use the values down:
Login: Admin
Password: Admin
